Honey?
- Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Lubitch.
- Hi, Doctor.
I've just come
from the hospital.
The tests are in
and you're pregnant.
Congratulations.
That's wonderful.
Did you hear that, honey?
Call me if I can be of any help
with your decision.
Yeah. I'll do that, doctor.
Thanks very much.
Johnny…
I know, honey. I know.
I don't want to lose another baby.
Oh.
I couldn't bear it.
I just couldn't.
No way in the world
we're gonna lose this child.
Look, first of all
the odds are four to one against
there being any problem at all this time.
Honey, even if the worst happened
and the baby was born with no immunities
this time we're ready. I mean…
Immunologists
like Dr. Gunther,
they do know how
to save these children now.
But how can we make a decision like that
for another human being?
I mean what if…
Oh Johnny,
do you think we could live with it?
There were never
two people in the world
more meant to be parents
than you and me.
God knows that.
I want to believe that.
Oh, I wanna believe that.
A baby. We're gonna have a baby.
A baby.
Mr. Lubitch, if you'd like to say
something to your wife before…
Hello, Mrs. Lubitch.
I just wanted to say…
I love you.
May we have the air conditioning ducts
and the heat vents closed, please?
And no movement
while the air settles.
Anybody down there
planning on having an itch,
please scratch it now,
not later, please.
Doctor Gunther, do we have to have
all these people here?
May we please clear the theater?
I'm sorry. Please,
try to understand we're…
private people.
Begin the caesarian.
I just saw him.
He's a beautiful baby.
Johnny, what a beautiful baby he is!
Look at those blue eyes.
Hey, Toddy. It's your daddy.
I think he knows me.
How were the tests?
Mr. and Mrs. Lubitch, he was born exactly
like your first son,
with no immunities whatsoever.
But he's alive.
How long does he have
to stay in this?
There's no way to know.
Until we discover a treatment,
until he develops
an immune system of his own,
he'll have to remain
in his protective environment.
Surely you can give us
some kind of prediction.
I mean, are we talking about
days or weeks or months?
Years.
Excuse me?
Mr. Lubitch, you may well
have it straight.
We could get lucky,
or your son could be here with us
for the remainder of his life.
- May I?
- Of course.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Are you going over there
this morning, honey?
What for?
- Come again?
- I said "what for".
Hey, what's the matter?
Oh, I hate seeing that little girl nearby.
I'm always looking at her.
You almost fell out.
I'm kinda sorry that
they moved next door.
I want my baby.
Mickey, look. Suppose we could devise
some way of transporting him safely.
And we could get them
to go on paying for it.
And then there's a million more
other things we'd have to do.
The sterilization, the food
and the toys and the equipment.
I don't think you realize
what would be getting ourselves into
if we did bring him home. Do you?
Now…
you stay home and get some rest.
I'll give him a big hug
for both of us, okay?
- Higher?
- Yeah.
Give me a kiss
Oh, boy!
Do you wanna play ball?
Do you wanna play ball?
Get your ball.
We're gonna toss.
You get over here,
why don't you.
Okay, look out.
Here it comes.
Oh, good! Try again.
Now you throw it to me.
Good one!
Good, man!
Throw it right here.
I don’t know whether I’m gonna
make a pitcher or a catcher out of you.
Okay, Toddy.
Throw me a nice high one.
There you go.
That's a good boy.
Okay, here it comes.
There you go.
Hey, look who is here, Toddy.
It's mommy.
Surprised to see me?
- No.
- No?
What about you,
shortstop?
Huh, are you surprised
to see mommy?
You are?
Ohh, I bet I can do
something fun to you.
I bet I can tickle you
and make you giggle.
Come here.
Come here. Ohhh.
Do you know how much
your mommy and daddy love you?
Do you?
And how much we want you
all to ourselves?
I love you. Ohh.
Baby I wanna give him a kiss,
I wanna give him a kiss.
Do you wanna give me another kiss?
Give me a kiss.
Here they come!
Hurry up! Set up!
I got a microphone.
We're rolling?
Take up the ambulance.
Little Todd Lubitch,
the child who has never felt
his parent's touch except
through the wall of his plastic bubble
and who may not
for years to come
is finally coming home
for the first time today.
Please, everybody,
we appreciate your interest but
it's exactly what we are going
to get away from.
Will you back up
everybody, please?
Would you mind backing up this
a little bit?
Oh, my, I didn't realized
he was so big.
Isn't he adorable?
Gina, come on back here.
Please, no pictures.
Mr. Lubitch, won't you come out
again and give us…
Take one more step and
I'm going to knock your damn head off.
Now, get out of here!
Come on!
Back up!
I'm a monster! I'm a monster!
My son is not a freak!
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Let's go.
Okay. Filters and fans?
They're okay.
Alright. Backup generator?
Okay.
Okay. Let's see.
Breaker and fuse panels?
Also right.
And…
intercom system.
Right. That's it.
Are you sure
we have checked everything?
Well…
everything except champagne.
Well, huh… In that case
I was just going to tuck him in
and I'll see you in a minute.
- Don’t be too long.
- Okay.
Good night, Toddy.
Come on, Toddy.
Night night time! Come on!
That's my darling.
Night, night time.
Okay. Now you have pleasant dreams.
You talk to your teddy bear, okay?
Mommy loves you.
I'll see you in the morning.
Good night.
Champagne okay.
Do you realize how long it's been?
Yeah.
He's not getting any air.
Honey, check the fans.
Toddy, what is it?
I don't know.
Everything is running!
Checked the generator?
Toddy, what is it?
Oh, my god. He's swallowed it.
Toddy come on now.
Daddy’s gonna lift you up.
Spit it up, baby!
Spit it up!
Oh, Toddy. I'm sorry, baby.
Are you okay?
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
You okay?
Poor baby.
- We did it.
- We sure did.
- Mrs. Lubitch?
- Yeah.
I know we should have called first.
Oh, well, our number is not listed.
Well, we were just waiting
for the proper time to say hello.
I'm Pete Biggs, my wife Martha
and our daughter Gina.
We live right next door there.
Yes, I know.
I should have been the one
to welcome you into the neighborhood but…
Here.
It's a welcome-home present
for your little boy.
Thank you. Thank you.
That's very kind of you.
Please, come in.
I'm sorry we haven't been that friendly
but we just don't have that many visitors.
There, that's good, Toddy.
Now put the blue one here.
See if you can stack
another blue one on.
Oh, you gonna put it
up there. Huh?
Oops! Oops!
Honey, look who is here.
The Biggs from next door
come over to welcome Todd home.
Look Toddy,
Toddy, look who's here.
This is Gina. Come say hello to Gina.
Gina's brought you a present
which daddy’s gonna sterilize.
Come on, say "hi" to Gina.
Let me go! Let me go!
He's not hurting you.
He is just playing with you.
Is this your playhouse?
Can I come in? Can I?
Yeah.
Hey, Gina, what do you wanna do?
I don't know.
You wanna go down to the dock?
It must be real weird living
right next door to that kid.
Oh, no, not really.
Like I hardly ever see him except
for birthdays and stuff.
Half the time he is
at the hospital, anyway.
Come on!
He's always watching television,
you know?
Never comes out of his room.
Does he have any friends?
Just old people.
Like friends of his parents,
a bunch of doctors that come over…
There's some minister or something
comes over once in a while
but no kids or anything.
Oh, he has this little pet,
germ-free mouse too.
Don't you ever wonder
what it's like in there?
I mean, to be
all by yourself like that.
Yeah, I know.
But he is weird, you know?
Like I'm surprised he isn't
looking at us right now.
Every time I look up there
he is looking right at me.
How are you, huh?
However the repair
of the bull-shaped radar antenna
proved
the more difficult task.
Located on the underside of Skylab's
multiple docking and ducted section,
the antenna is used to measure
irregularities in ground temperatures
and the shape
of the Earth.
Performing like an acrobatic team,
they worked for 3 hours on the faulty antenna,
till it was finally free enough to do
most of its programmed air scanning job.
Earlier today after the astronauts
docked their command module with Skylab
they settled in and started their
housekeeping chores.
After a rest period of two hours
they had their first meal in Skylab.
Hello, Mickey.
Good afternoon, Ernie
Please, come in.
Honey, look who is here to see you.
Hello, Tod!
Good afternoon, Ernie.
And how are we feeling today?
My main reason for driving out here today
instead of waiting for your monthly checkup
is there's some news I think you
might like to hear.
Queen's in check, Ernie.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
A doctor in Tokio believes
he may have found a treatment
that might stimulate the development
of the humoral and cellular antibodies.
What kinda research has he done?
So far, not too extensive.
But by the middle of next year…
That's good news Ernie.
Keep me posted, will you?
You really got it made,
haven’t you?
Why do you say that?
Because you've got the best excuse ever
devised by anybody to avoid growing up.
I'm growing up, Ernie.
Yes. Sometimes
you're like an old man.
Another times
you're like a newborn baby.
What does that mean?
Why do you use an intercom
when you don't need to?
To give you a feeling
of power over us?
Is this your way
of getting back at us?
You're angry at me today,
aren't you, Ernie?
Yes, you're right, I am.
Well, look, Ernie.
You don't know any more
than you did in the beginning, do you?
I mean. So, why should I care about
what's going on out there?
Why should I care about
anything that's going on out there?
Because there may be a cure, anytime.
The doctor in Tokio, your own body.
Ah, bull.
You know, I'm not so unhappy
in here as all of you think.
Really.
I'll see you, Todd.
Carter greased the railing
on the stairway
between the first
and the second floor
and Mr. Brister took
quite a nasty tumble.
Todd, the school board
called me today.
And a company back east has donated
a closed-circuit television system.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah
And they wanna know
if you would like to use it
to monitor some classes
in the high school.
What classes?
Any classes you want.
Come on. You're not afraid to test
that brain of yours
against the other kids, are you?
- No.
- Well…
Honey, if it's too abrupt a step
for you right now, that's okay.
I didn't mean to sound
as if I was pushing but…
What's happened to that doctor
that Ernie was talking about last week?
You know, the one from Tokio.
Well, we haven't heard anything
about him yet, honey,
but there's a rheumatologist
in Finland…
I gotta think about
that school thing.
May I please be excused?
- Of course, Todd.
- Sure.
Gwen, what is all this?
Don't you know?
That was your neighbor,
the boy in the bubble.
He's gonna monitor some classes on TV.
And he chose our homeroom.
He did?
Yeah. Come on!
All right, you're on, Todd.
I can't see anything.
Well, try your scanner button.
Hey, Gina,
your true love has found you.
Todd, can you hear me?
- Hi, dad.
- Hi.
I want you to meet your homeroom
teacher. This is Mr. Brister.
Good morning, Todd.
Would you like to say
something to the class before we begin?
Hi, everybody.
So, as the Truman administration
was "the fair deal"
and the Kennedy administration
"the new frontier"
and the Johnson administration
called itself "the great society"
What was the Roosevelt administration?
Tom Schuster?
Gwen?
Who's making that sound?
Gina Bates?
Sorry, Mr. Brister,
I didn't read the chapter.
Todd?
The new deal.
Good.
Now.
What's so funny?
All right. This has gone far enough.
Unless every one of you
want to be sent down
to the principal's office,
you'll cut it out right now.
- Hey, Tom. Go out for a pass.
- Okay.
You know,
if they can take him to and from
the hospital in that small bubble
why don't they ever carry him outside
or down to the beach or something?
Well, they've been
suggesting it for years.
But Todd won't have
any part of it.
He says it'll make him feel
like a freak being put on display.
Gina, go over to the Lubitches.
Ask Todd if he'd like to come
to the 4th of July party at the beach.
But, why don't you just call
his parents or something?
I want it
to come from you.
All right, I'll try.
Missy…
-Hi, Mrs. Lubitch.
-Hi, Gina.
Is Todd home?
Yes, Todd is home.
- Go on up inside.
- Thank you.
Todd?
Hey in there.
It's me.
Surprised to see me?
Aren't you gonna say something?
Like "hi"?
Hi
Hey, you know, I've always
wondered about this.
What's that?
How come this part is open?
I mean, don't germs get in?
Well. You see, behind this wall
there's lots of air vents
that constantly blow out
all the air so that -
so that germs won't get in.
You see this line down here?
I can't walk past it.
- No kidding?
- No.
You mean, I couldn't put my foot
over that line?
No. Your germs would get in.
Hey Todd. My mom said that you've
never even been sick or anything.
Not even a cold.
Is that true?
Yeah. How do you like that?
Well…
So, when you supposed to get out?
Oh, I don't know.
Keep on looking for treatments.
But they've been looking for them
all my life.
But my immunities keep on building up
and all that.
So, even if they don't find the treatment
you'll get out some day, right?
Yeah, some day.
Well, the reason I'm here is…
I wanted to invite you
to the 4th of July party at the beach.
If you can't make it, you know,
everybody'll understand but…
at least you know that
all we wanted you to come.
Well. Hope you can make it.
Yeah. Okay. Set up.
I'm gonna release it.
Here we go.
Okay, let me get the plug here.
Honey, do you wanna
turn main switch on?
Happy 4th of July, son.
- Okay, where is food?
- Here.
Hi, Todd.
Glad you could come.
What do you think
of my horse?
Oh, I love him.
I watch you feed him every morning
and I love to watch you ride him.
Do you always talk like that?
"I love this", "I love that"…
But I do, I really do.
Yeah. But I mean,
you shouldn't tell people.
Why not?
Because!
People'll think you're dumb.
So, you like my horse, huh?
Well, maybe I'll let you ride him
when you get out.
Will you really, Gina?
See you later.
I dare you.
How much?
I'll give you two dollars
if you hold his hand in the fire
Let me see the money.
I don't believe you.
You mean you're really gonna do it?
- It's right here.
- Okay.
- Hi, Todd.
- Hi.
Todd,
let's hold hands.
What for?
I'd just like
to hold hands with you.
Don't you know?
When two people like each other,
specially a boy and a girl
they like to hold hands.
- Gina
- Yes?
Do you really like me?
Well, hold my hand
and find out.
Gina, where you going?
All right, you turkeys.
Cough up the money.
You did a good job.
One, two… Thank you.
Gina, what'd you run away for?
Come back. Talk to me.
Todd
Don't you know?
It was a dare.
They dared me,
so I had to do it.
Poor guy.
You didn't think
I was serious, did you?
I hate it!
I hate it!
Todd. No, Todd.
What's the matter?
Todd, no.
What happened?
What did she say to you?
What did you say to him?
- I'm gonna take you home.
- I don't wanna go.
Just take me to the hospital!
Just take me to the hospital,
will you?
Alright?
Calm down.
This isn't the way to my room.
You won't be staying in the old part
of the hospital anymore, Todd.
You'll be staying here,
in the new laminar airflow center.
Because of what we've learned
through cases like yours
when out treating cancer patients
undergoing chemotherapy,
leukemia patients.
All kinds of people,
young and old,
who'd developed immune
deficiencies like yourself
for one reason or another.
I've taken the liberty
of tentatively selecting your roommate.
A roommate?
But if you're unhappy
I'm sure something can be arranged.
Todd Lubitch,
meet Roy Slater.
Hi.
Well, I'll leave you two, fellows,
to get to know each other.
You've been in one of these things
all of your life,
what's that been like?
Me, I've been in here
a couple of months and…
I don't know,
I sure miss a lot of things.
What's the matter with you?
Tumor.
So, why are you in one
of these things?
The chemotherapy
kills off all my immunities.
Do you know? I'm really glad
I've got someone to talk to now.
Well, they tried me with
a couple of others before
but you're the first one
who is even close to my age.
I sure hope
we can become friends.
Hey, why don't you
talk to me?
I have so many things
I wanna ask you.
Just let me ask you
one question, okay?
Okay.
What do you do
to start liking it?
Todd?
Aren't you gonna answer me?
You said I could ask you
one question.
Yeah, but I didn't say
I'd answer it.
Why is it!
Why is it!
Okay, okay!
I'll answer anything you want.
Just stop crying, alright?
You mean it?
Yeah, I mean it, you dorko.
- Todd…
- Yeah?
- When are you supposed to get out?
- I don't know.
They tell me
my immunities are building up
But who knows,
I might never get out of this damned thing.
Well, if I was never
gonna get out of here
I don't think I could keep
going on, you know?
Easy. You can do it easy.
You know what really bugs me?
What?
That when they discovered the tumor
I was too young for girls, you know?
Yeah.
And now that I'm old enough
I can't do anything about it.
Sometimes I just get so…
I can't stand it!
When I think
of all my friends out there,
going to drive-ins and making out
and getting all that action…
You know the first thing
I'm gonna do when I get out of here
is get myself a hooker.
Won't you be afraid of germs?
Germs?
I want the germs.
I wanna be dirty,
really dirty, you know?
I wanna grow my hair real long
and have a beard and a mustache
and I wanna make out
with everything that walks.
- Roy
- Yeah?
Do you ever…
Do you ever… you know.
All the time.
Me too.
Astronaut Buzz Aldrin visits
young Todd Lubitch,
the boy who was grown up
inside a plastic bubble.
That's Todd!
I wanna see this. Hold on.
He's coming home next week.
- So what?
- Shhh
Hi, Todd.
You - You're Buzz Aldrin, aren't you?
The man who walked on the moon.
Oh. God, I don't believe this.
You know, I've been looking forward
to meeting you, Todd.
I heard
you have the record
for the longest time
on a command module.
Yeah, I guess so.
I've got a little something
for you too.
To Todd, champion
spaceman on Earth. Buzz Aldrin
Thank you.
Hey, you spent some time
in one of these things, didn't you?
Right after
the moon flight.
Something very much
alike it, Todd.
We were in germ control
quarters for several weeks.
What was it like for you?
The thing I remember most
was the loss of freedom.
You know, I felt
like being in a fish ball.
I - I know what you mean.
Todd Lubitch,
the boy who has spent his life
in a plastic bubble.
No, Tom.
My parents are gonna
be home in a minute, okay?
What is it with you
and that freak?
He's my next door neighbor.
We grew up together.
Is anything wrong with that?
Don't call him out freak.
I think you're turning on to him.
Oh, Tom. You're such an idiot.
How long have I lived
next to him? Twelve years?
I've probably spoken to him
maybe a dozen times at the most.
Every year I got an invitation
to his birthday party.
And every year I went,
I was the only one there.
Except for his parents.
It's the only time
I ever saw him.
Just once a year.
Except for the 4th of July.
Mr. Lubitch?
Yeah. What is it Gina?
I'm in a big rush.
I hear Todd
is gonna monitor
some classes
again this year.
That's why I'm rushing.
I've got books to get at the library.
and supplies to pick up before
the stores close.
Listen. I can do all that
for you if you want.
What's the catch, Gina?
Well, the main thing is…
I feel bad about what happened.
And I'd like to help out.
The other thing is I…
I'm broke and
I could really use the money.
Okay. That's a deal.
Hello!
I brought you the books
and supplies that you needed.
And your homework's in there too.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
If you want me to
bring any classwork
with me to school in the morning
just have your mom leave it
on the front porch
and I'll pick it on my way.
Wait a minute.
I wanna ask you something.
Why are you doing this?
Just 'cause I -
cause I want to.
Does my father
have anything to do with it?
Well, yeah. Kind of.
Is he paying you?
Yeah.
Thank you for being honest.
You can go now.
No, but I suggested it.
What I mean is…
It's always so hard
to talk to you.
You take everything so literally.
Say what you started to say.
Do you have to use that thing?
It's killing my ears.
Say what you started to say.
Well… I thought a lot about…
what happened last 4th of July.
And I wanted to
make it up to you somehow.
And… when I saw your father
at school today, well…
I was gonna
do it for nothing
but then another part
of me said "well…"
I understand.
You're not mad
at me any more?
Hey, does that Mr. Brister look as old
in person as he does in television?
Mr. Brister…
God, I hate that guy.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, how come you're never
wearing anything except shorts?
Because it's so warm in here.
Really, Todd. I mean,
when I come over the least you could do
is put on some clothes.
How long has it been
since you had a shower?
I can't have showers.
Baths are a major production.
You should see, it takes a couple of hours
just to sterilize the water.
You must stink in there.
Oh, no. No, you're wrong.
No germs, no smell.
I don't know, Todd.
I mean, it's just the
principal of the thing, you know?
Well, hasta mañana.
Thus, despite Wilson's stand
on the league of nations
congress had voted against
the entry of the United States.
America now embraced a policy
of isolationism,
focusing her attentions
inward on domestic concerns.
Thereby pursuing a course
of action which was
ultimately to pave the way
for World War II.
For tomorrow we will read
chapters 4, 5 and 6.
I wish you wouldn't
look at me like that.
Look, I didn't come yesterday
because I couldn't.
Look, to begin with,
Mr. Goodwin made me stay
after class to rewrite
that term paper for English Lit
and then I got called down
to the Principal's office
for a nice little talking-to.
And then, when I got home
my parents were already…
Gina, you don't have to lie at me.
I'm not lying to you.
And stop using that thing.
It hurts my ears.
You can go now, Gina.
I'm not your slave, Todd,
so don't give me orders.
You're just like anybody else.
Nobody ever believes me!
I'm flunking out of school,
that's how come I had to stay.
The only course
I have higher than a D is in art.
I didn't know that, Gina.
Well, now you do.
And you can forget about
me coming over any more.
Since everyone else
thinks I'm letting'em down
last thing I need is
the same garbage from you.
Gina, I'm sorry.
Maybe I could help you.
How?
I can explain things
better than those dumb teachers.
I could teach you
how to really concentrate.
- You'd do that?
- Sure.
What's my father paying you?
A dollar an hour.
That's how much I charge.
Gina, you can see my rates.
They're right over here.
Okay, it's a deal.
Todd, how do you like
my hair better?
Up, in a pony-tail like this
or maybe straight down like this?
Well, which do you like better?
I think I like it
straight down better, don't you?
You think I'm beautiful, don't you?
So do I.
Hey, Todd. For the test tomorrow,
do you think we could do it another way?
What do you mean?
Let me cheat off your paper.
Gina
Todd, what are you doing?
I'm finished.
Of course.
But wait until the others have finished
before you hold up your answers.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brister.
Be careful, mom.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
Very good.
Excellent.
- Where do you wanna go?
- To the right.
- My right or your right?
- My right.
Okay.
Hey, you,
what's the sudden interest
in all the great outdoors?
I need a tan.
Need what?
I need a tan.
Look at me.
I look like a tuna fish.
All white and everything
You know, you guys
could use a little sunshine yourselves
You're starting to look real old.
Todd…
Dad, I don't mean to hurt
your feelings but it's true.
I mean, you never
take a vacation,
or buy new clothes.
Look at that dress, mom.
Dad, you never
do anything for yourselves.
- Todd
- Yeah?
Do you ever blame us
for bringing you into the world?
Did you have a choice?
Yes.
Well, do you blame yourselves?
Sometimes.
Mom, dad, I don't blame you for anything.
Honest.
I love you.
I love you both.
Don't you know that?
I mean. Look. If it weren't for what you did
I would have grown up in the hospital.
You know, you should hire a nurse
from the hospital to take care of me.
So that you can go to some place
you always wanted to go to.
Todd
Dad, It'd be okay.
I'd love it.
I mean,
just knowing that
you aren't spending
your whole life on me.
Okay?
Do it.
Sweetheart,
I'll meet you outside.
Rachel, don't forget to test
the backup generator
at least once a day.
And if anything goes wrong…
don't hesitate to call us.
Don't worry about a thing.
We'll be at that number.
- Bye bye.
- Have a good trip.
Honey, I hope
we're doing the right thing,
so much could go wrong.
Sure we are.
This trip is for him too,
you know.
Give him a little growing room
and then he can feel
like he can stand
on his own two feet.
- Do you know what I think?
- What?
I think part of the reason
he want us out of the way
is so that he can court his girl.
Yeah.
Todd? Bye bye!
Good bye, son.
Todd! Look!
My report card for the semester.
A in art and all the rest are B's.
No kidding.
- Well, thanks to you.
- Yeah.
- Hey, let's celebrate, okay?
- How?
I don't know.
Think of something
you'd like to do,
something special.
Oh, Todd, really!
The way you look at me sometimes!
Well, think of something.
Okay. Take me
to ride with you.
Oh, sure. What are you gonna do?
Just walk out of there?
I might.
No, dummy. Just help Rachel
take me outside so I can watch you.
Are you crazy?
The two of us
would never get you down the stairs.
Sure. Sure you could easy.
You see? I told you it'd work.
Okay, keep up going.
- My slaves.
- Oh, Todd
All right.
A little more, to the left.
Okay. That's it.
Do you know how to put me down?
That's it.
Thank you.
Gina, come here.
Rachel, will you plug
me in, in the extension?
When she does that
will you turn off the battery?
Okay
That's it Rachel.
Excellent.
Thank you.
Thank you Rachie.
You can go now.
- Gina, ride for me, okay?
- Okay.
Gina, go around that tree
and then
jump over the canoe and
come back as fast as you can.
Gina, you move so fast!
What does it feel like
to move that fast?
Feels like flying.
Gina, ride around me in a circle,
as close as you can, okay?
But what about the cord?
What about the cord?
You just jumped that canoe.
You can jump
that stupid cord.
What about your nurse?
Oh, this is the time of day
when she drinks sherry.
She just sits there,
look at the plug
makes sure that doesn't come out.
Then she gets pleasantly bombed.
So, don't worry about her, okay?
Okay.
Faster, Gina! Faster!
Faster, Gina!
Now jump over me, Gina.
- Jump over me, Gina.
- No way, Todd.
Come on!
Gina, you just
jumped over the canoe.
I've seen you jump
twice as high.
Todd, what if I miss?
You won't miss. I know you.
You're too talented to miss.
Todd, you are really a weird kid,
do you know that?
Yeah, I know it.
Just do it, Gina. Okay?
Okay.
Dear Lord.
That was so great!
I was so scared.
Were you scared?
Not once.
Oh, I don't believe you.
Aren't you gonna get out of this thing?
I don't know.
I've got to split.
Listen, I'll be back later
to help you get inside, okay?
Which one is he?
Well, that's Tom.
Bruce drives a blue Chevy.
It's he the one
you're going with?
Who says
I'm going with anybody?
Todd
Put your face up
against the plastic.
What for?
I did what you wanted me to do.
Now do it.
- I told you you look terrific.
- Oh, thank you.
Here, you you take your presents
and I'll get the bags.
Let's surprise him now.
- Now?
- Yeah
- Todd, hi!
- Hi!
- Did you have a good time?
- Yes.
- How was it?
- It was fine.
Todd, listen. What is about Gina
jumping over you with her horse?
Oh, it's nothing.
Did she tell you that?
She drinks.
Oh, Todd.
No. She probably
imagined it.
Todd, that's wicked.
Listen, I've got something
I want to tell you.
I wanna go to school.
But you are in school.
No, I mean, really go to school.
Doctor Gunther said he'd set it up
if you guys said it'd be all right.
Here, look. I'll show you.
See?
Pretty neat, huh?
My goodness.
Okay, Todd,
come on out.
Let's go.
You sure you wanna go today?
Yeah.
Okay, let's go.
Okay, last time.
What's the first thing
you do when you get to your homeroom?
Pledge of Allegiance.
The first thing, you ding-a-ling.
All right. First thing I do
is check the backup tapes.
- And?
- And the batteries.
Come on, dad.
Can't you go any faster?
Just leave the driving to me, okay?
Listen then.
Filters and defense are fine,
the batteries are up,
but the pressure gage
on the main line reads 75%.
Then what do you do?
I don't do anything
Just stay there,
I get the teacher to get you
and then you take me home, right?
Okay. Good.
I want you to check
everything on your checklist
every break
between classes.
Or I'll break your arm.
Alright.
Okay.
Get your current
where you find it.
Think of yourself
as a rechargeable flashlight.
Cause you want me
to be bright, right?
A little joke, dad.
Very.
You're on your own.
Mr. Brister?
Yes, Gina.
I just wanted to say that…
I think it's really brave
of Todd to do this.
And I think
we should all show him
how glad we are
that he's here.
Come on! Stand up!
Come on, get up!
Gwen, aren't you accepted
to Colorado?
Yeah.
- Did you hear from your art school?
- No, not yet.
Oh, don't worry about that.
You'll hear from it.
Hey, you guys, why don't we
go over and talk to Todd?
I don't know.
He's really weird.
Come on.
Hi, Todd.
Todd, I want you to meet
some of my friends.
You know Tom and Bruce.
And this is Gwen and Debbie and Smith.
How are you doing?
I see you got yourself
all plugged in.
I saw you on the news.
You looked great.
I'm Tom.
No, man. We do it like this.
This means we're brothers.
How much time
do you have on one tank?
90 minutes.
- And then what?
- Then I recharge.
It's what I'm doing
right now.
You see? I'm recharging.
Could I ask you a question?
Yes.
Do you ever feel
like a visitor from outer space?
Yes.
Me too.
Now, listen, Todd.
We were all about to take a little walk
over to the football field.
Would you like to come with us?
No more practical jokes.
You can trust us.
Yeah. I think we've grown up
a little since last summer.
Okay.
Hey, when I pull this plug out,
will you turn my battery on?
A little black dial?
Okay.
When I say "ready".
Ready? Go.
Hey, Todd. There's something
I've been wanting to ask you.
- How do you go to the bathroom?
- Oh, the same as the astronauts do.
- You mean…
- Sure.
Sorry I asked.
You look so funny in that thing.
You've got to be able
to laugh at yourself.
I know what this is like.
What? What is like?
I know what that's like.
Do you know what I do?
What I do is like
I stare at an object for a long time.
Any object, right?
And then I let myself sink
deeper and deeper inside my brain
until I find
the center place that I like.
Have you guys ever heard
of out-of-body travel?
Sure. I saw a thing about it
on Twilight Zone once.
This way you can leave your body
and go anywhere you want.
That's right.
Well, I do it all the time.
Oh, yeah?
Where do you go?
Lots of different places.
But mostly the planet
that I'm from, Thermopolous.
Come on!
I think it's an exchange program.
You see, I was sent here
and someone from here was sent there.
One day we'll be
switched back again.
If it weren't for this
secret journal I found
I would have never known
anything about it.
- Are you putting us on?
- No.
Let me look inside
that thing, Todd Lubitch.
Look at that straight face.
Hey, no!
I think you are
from another planet.
We better go back.
Hey Tom,
I bet you didn't know
that people on Thermopolous
are stronger than people on Earth.
- No kidding. Stronger in what way?
- Just stronger.
Like our first set
I could beat you doing push-ups.
You're talking about
real money or space money?
I'm talking 10 dollars.
Sounds okay to me.
Let's make it the kind that you have to
clap in the middle, all right?
All right.
Hey, Todd, do you think
you should do this?
I mean, what about
your - your air?
Todd, what's the matter?
Are you all right?
No air!
Get me to the bubble!
Quick!
Todd?
Todd, you're alright?
Please, don't tell my father.
No. We won't tell anybody.
Hey, where's my ten bucks?
Todd, I've got to talk to you.
I know. You're mad at me, aren't you?
Yes, I'm mad at you.
For embarrassing you
in front of your friends?
No, for nearly killing yourself
trying to show up for me.
But Gina, I was just…
Todd, what if you had died out there?
How could I have lived with that?
- I'm sorry, Gina.
- No, you're not.
You don't care!
You don't care
what happens to you, Todd.
Sometimes I think
you wanna die.
Gina I was just doing it
so you'd see.
See what?
That you're just as dumb
as all the rest of them?
Flexing your muscles?
No, that you'd see that
I'm not a crippled one.
Now, that's nothing
wrong with me except that
I can't get out of here
until they tell me it's okay.
Oh, Gina, I'm so sick of it.
I'm so sick of feeling like
a hospital case.
Like some weird-o-kid who
can't even breathe normal air
cause he might get sick and die.
I just wanted to be like a man.
Someone you could care about,
not feel sorry for.
Todd, I don't know
what you're doing to me.
And I don't know
if I like it at all.
I don't know anything at all.
Look, we were just
supposed to be friends.
I mean, that's all
that was supposed to happen, right?
978
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,000f
I mean, can't we just
leave it like that?
Hello. Yeah.
Gina? it's for you, sweetheart.
You wanna watch the
sports news on channel 3?
Gina? Hi.
You wanna go to the beach tomorrow?
Okay.
Oh, Todd! Here.
It's great!
It's going up so high. Wow!
Oh, honey. Look at 'em.
Just look at 'em.
Todd, you've got
5 minutes left on your tank.
This was fun today.
Why couldn't you have had a spacesuit
when you were a little kid?
Oh, when I was little,
I never even dreamed
about going out.
Only about people
and things coming in.
You were always
riding your horse in.
Yeah. And then I'd get on.
And we'd ride, and ride, and ride.
- Inside your bubble?
- Yeah. Always inside.
All my life I've wondered
what it's like to be you.
And all my life I've always wondered
what it was like to be you.
I've always loved you, Gina.
I know.

Todd Lubitch
Hey, Todd!
Todd?
Look, it just came
in the mail.
I wanted you
to be the first to know.
My acceptance
at Pratt Institute.
I start art school in September, Todd.
In New York City.
And it never would have happened
if you hadn't helped me.
That's great, Gina.
Really it is.
Hey, Todd,
I won't be leaving
for a while.
Hello, Todd.
What did you wanna see me about?
I wanna know when
I can leave, Ernie.
Well, within the past week
I've been in telephone communication
with a team of physicians
in the Soviet Union.
How soon could I leave
on my own immunities?
You know I can't answer that.
What would happen if I left now?
You're not actually considering…
Would I catch something
and die right away?
I really don't know.
Do you mean I might live?
Yes, that's conceivable.
Your body's been building some immunities.
But it's also conceivable that
just a bad cold or a case of flu
might kill you.
I'm sorry but
we just don't know.
Thank you for coming, Ernie.
Todd
If somewhere in that brain of yours
you're actually thinking of…
I was just asking, Ernie.
That's all.
Todd!
It's so much softer
than I ever imagined.
Gina, take me for a ride.
It'll be alright.
Okay.
Where are we going?
To Thermopolous!
