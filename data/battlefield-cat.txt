The entire tribe must not be endangered...

because of the defiance of one person.
You must forget about him.
They want to have fun.
He was a wild spirit and this was always to be his fate.
You talk as if he's already dead
So we sat in the house
Even if he does survive this time, he's a greener...
so set your sights elsewhere for a husband.
I'll never set my sights elsewhere.
And she said to us two,
Sit!
And the cat went away
This is all the medicine I could find. -I'm sorry.
The gods took your father in the night.
As long as we stay here, there'll never be enough to eat. Never.
There may be other places we could live where food is plentiful.

All it takes is one demon to follow you back from the forbidden land.
Then we'd all be struck down.
We looked!
Have you ever seen one?
Have you?
Has anyone here ever seen one?
A demon?
A monster!
A beast!
In this house! Make them go!
The stories are true.
The gods used to live here.
Have no fear of this mess,
They watched over and protected man, but man grew selfish...
and cruel. So the gods left...
Look at me!
allowing the demons to descend from the sky.
As survivors, we must dedicate our lives to pleasing the gods...
I can hold the toy ship
so that one day they will come back and drive away the demons.
That is our fate.
Only if you believe in fate.
I'm sorry. I can't take you.
I can't handle myself as well as a man?
No. -You arrogant greener.
You can handle yourself better than most men...
which is why you need to help the village.

Your mother gave this to me before she died.
She hoped it'd be passed to your children.
It's for good luck.
Don't let anything happen to you out there.
Easy!
Easy!
So you're the beast we're all afraid of.
Not a lot of meat on a dragon.
You have been fortunate in the hunt.
I hope you thanked the gods.
A nonbeliever. -I believe what I can see.
I know some good games we could play,
A nonbeliever, huh? You from the caves?
UP-UP-UP with a fish!
Probably never seen a god. Would you like to?
What do you know about gods? -We've seen gods. Rock and l.
Her gown with the dots
You lying thieves.
On this wet, wet, wet day.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, we're hunting.
No time to show you gods with no food.
And look! With my tail
We need food. We must hunt. Nonbeliever.
Wait.
First you show me the god.
Now you do as I say.
Then we eat.
Look at me!
Look.
Frozen ones.
The way to the great god village is marked by these frozen ones.
When the gods left this world, they ordered man not to look at them.
And a cup on my hat!
Oh, what would she say!
Those that disobeyed were frozen in place for all of eternity.
When the gods lived here they could fly through the air.
Not one little bit.
They'd drive chariots in front of special caves with golden arches.
Golden.
And the food would magically appear.
Magic.
Here!
The gods weren't allowed to fall in love with mortal women.
This one did...
and was left behind, frozen as punishment.
Are you sure this was a god?
I thought you said you believe what you can see.

If you need proof...
when the sun goes down, you can see the rest of the gods in the sky.
They're the bright lights.
The evil beasts hunt in the dark. We need to find shelter.
There's a cave over here.
Look at those poor bastards. They really angered the gods.
Carlo.
Let's eat.
Go. Go.
What's a greener?
The grass is greener on the other side.
Your mother
I will NOT go away.
Always looking for something better, something out there.
That are pink, white and red.
Maybe she was right.
God stone.
Sharp.
No, you keep it. You keep it.
Where we're from, a good woman is a hard thing to find.
So if you were stupid enough to leave a good woman behind...
why don't you tell me where she is so I can go get her for myself?
No!
Forget about me. Get out of here. I can't move!
No!
Oh, heavenly gods!
The !
Don't breathe the air!
Then he fell on his head!
That is good, said the fish.
It's poison!
My chest is on fire!

It helps you breathe. Take it!
I can't!
Get off my brother.
And so...
What's he saying? -Don't know.
Who's responsible for allowing him to run around?
He shot the wrangler.
Then I let down my net.
I'm a little pressed for time. Save the going-away jokes for later.
No joke, sir. I swear.
The man-animal got ahold of this gun.
Really?
Show me.
Sir?
Reach for the gun.
And we did not like it.
But, sir, I might get shot.
Sure, you might. And I might suddenly grow a third arm!
Said the
But it shot the wrangler.
Any report filed today still has my name on it...
and you are out of your skull-bone if you think I'm going to write...
 shot by a man-animal as the cause of death unless I see it!
If I obey your command, I may get killed.
If you don't, it's a certainty you will be killed.
Reach for the gun.
But our fish said, No! No!
Well, I'll be damned.
Teleportation sequence activated.
Teleportation sequence activated.
It is a pleasure to see you, Your Excellency.
I would be honored to expedite your clearance through security.
Please, call me Zete. Does all of Earth look like this?
And I said,
I'm afraid so, sir.
Pathetic. All the green and the blue sky.
They told me this planet was ugly, but this is one of the ugliest...
And the fish on a rake!

I call this game FUN-IN-A-BOX,
...in the entire universe. -I couldn't agree more.
I hate these puny, undersized planets. The gravity is so different.
One does get used to it.
I can hold up these books!
Thing One and Thing Two!
And the human-animals, grossly undersized.
They don't make good eating, Your Excellency.
If your mother asked YOU?
My executive assistant, Ker. -Thank you.
He has been fully trained to replace me as chief of security.
As soon as my transfer goes through. -Well, Ker...
Came Thing Two and Thing One!
Oh dear.
once we finish mining out this miserable little planet...
Iet's do the universe a favor.
Let's exterminate the lot of them.
Oh, you're too much. -So they tell me.
Please, come this way.
Spy satellites recorded those.
What is this species? -According to the Clinko historians...

the species is called dog. 
Why, we can have
Dog. -Yes.
What a shame!
Obviously the superior race, having the man-animal chauffeur.
Well, dogs did prove to be more cooperative than the man-animals.
They weren't as useful when it came to manual labor.
I am honored by your visit, Your Excellency.
These Things will not bite you.
Thank you, Planetship.
You'll be pleased. I approved additional labor resources.
They'll be here by the end of quarter cycle.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
I do NOT wish to go!
Now, let's see.
Your long overdue transfer.
You must be looking forward to getting off this disgusting excuse of a planet.
I just want to do whatever serves the corporation best, sir.
Thoe two Things had to stop.
Saw them run down the hall.
Very admirable. And I must say, you've done...
a first-rate job here as interim security chief.
Did you have any fun?
You will like these two things,
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!
Not one little bit! Then Sally and I
I do what I can.
So we've decided to keep you for another tour of service.
There must be some mistake.
Home Office does not make mistakes.
Of course not. But have you looked at my file?
In the box with the hook.
And all kinds of bad tricks.
You get out of this house!
It explicitly says that this is a temporary assignment.
Are you not aware that I graduated top of my class?
Quite an accomplishment.
I don't mean to second-guess the Home Office...
It came down with a PLOP!
but surely I could be of better service--
Home Office is well aware of your academic achievements and talents.
That's why we've decided not to keep you here for another five cycles.
It's a joke.
This is no fun at all!
Thank you, sir.
I don't know if I could've kept my sanity...
To the fish in the pot.
to be here another five cycles.
We've decided to keep you here for another 50 cycles!
With endless options for renewal!
Those options, of course...
being at Home Office's discretion.
Not yours.
The senator...
So, DO something! Fast! said the fish.
has a lot of friends.
Would you please tell the senator...
if I'd had even an inkling that that was his daughter--
Watch your tongue.
The senator's exact words to me were, and I'm quoting:
With a book on one hand!
If that blasted Terl tries to talk his way out of it...
have him vaporized on the spot. 
But that is not ALL I can do!
But cheer up. There's one bright side to this.
One day you're going to die, and when you end up in hell...
at least it'll be a step up from this place.
You haven't left for Psychlo.
Your powers of observation are simply startling.
Give me three pans to go.
I don't know what you're so down about.
Said the fish in the pot.
You still get to be head of security.
Lots of good fun that is funny!
All that cold, cold, wet day.
Which, from what I can tell, is a pretty cushy job.
Well, I can assure you...
that I was not groomed since birth to have some cushy job...
that even a moron like you could perform.
While you were still learning how to spell your name...
Your mother is on her way home!
I was being trained to conquer galaxies!
To do anything less...
is a disgrace to my entire family line.
I will show you
That'll be six credits.
Down the wall in the hall.
We saw ALL the things fall!
Put it on my tab.
He should not be here
Would you like to shake hands
You don't have a tab.
I do now.
You're new here, so I'll explain how it works.
I eat first.
Then my men eat.
You pack up those Things
If there's anything left, you can share it with them.
That's how it used to work.
Greener, let's just stay alive.
You're right.
So I'll fight you. -No.
Without food, we don't have strength to escape.

The things that went on there that day?
So now we're escaping? -I am.
Come if you want.
We fight, it's to the death.
Then he got up on top
Say your prayers to the gods!
We have enough problems without killing each other over food.
From now on, we eat at the same time.
Sir.
You SHOULD NOT be here
I was wondering when you'd look at that.
It came in last week, and I put it right in your box.
I've wasted my time, haven't l?
If you're going to lie to me, have the decency to do a credible job...
so I don't look like an idiot for training you.
But I'm not lying. I put the photo in your box as soon as it came in.
You are pathetic. You wouldn't last one day at the academy.
And I saw you. -What?
You said:
We use picto-cameras to spy on other offices.
But under no circumstance do we spy on our own office. 
That's right. We don't. I do.
I can hop up and down on the ball!
Start talking.
You did not like our game...
The photo's from last week's recon drone.
It shows a rockslide in the mountains. It exposed a gold vein.
You were waiting for me to transfer...
so you could turn it in and get credit.
I didn't think you'd mind.
I don't mind. Turn it in. But before you do, pretend you're not...
And some milk on a dish!
a complete imbecile...
With big bumps, jumps and kicks
and check the compo gradients.
It's full of uranium. No Psychlo...
can get there without his breath gas exploding. No way to mine the gold.
But what I do mind is that you betrayed me over a lousy recon photo!
Now! Now! Have no fear.
It's worthless! You said so!
But you didn't know it was worthless!
I would never hurt you, sir.
I'm unarmed. You can't shoot me. It's against regulations, sir.
I can make this up to you, sir. I promise. I swear.
Please, sir.
You do not have to shoot me, sir.
Shoot you? My most trusted colleague?
Of course not. We have work to do. Come.
Tomorrow morning, we must warn the Planetship of the mutiny.
What mutiny?
The one you're going to pretend is in the works...
Then he said, That is that.
Iike your life depended on it. Because it does.
If the worker revolt takes place, my informants tell me...
that the first order of business is to separate you from your head.
Said the
Which is why there will be no revolt.
That is not all....
I am authorizing you to use whatever means necessary to prevent it.

I will pick up the hook.
The best way is to increase profits and stop cutting the workers' pay.
Production equals profits.
And I've already ordered as many new workers as possible...
to boost production.
But we have to pay the new workers.
If Mother could see this,
Maybe you were absent the day they taught economics at the academy, Ker.
But nobody works for free.
Man-animals do.
What if we were to train them how to mine?
Man-animals operating machinery?
Have you blown a head gasket?
I will be the laughingstock of the universe.
Now, here is a game that they like,
So you should have me take man-animals...
with equipment, out to a remote area...
better that you don't know where, and try and train them.
Have them do some test mining.
If it doesn't work out, no one will know.
Right. -And if it does work...
I will be vaporized.
It is against the law.
Regulations say...
a Planetship faced with a profit-threatening situation...
is relieved of all other ordinances...
to pursue, to protect and to acquire said profits.
And they ran to us fast.
There you have it.
We stick to the original plan.
Bring in new workers...

Lots of good fun, if you wish,
and they go on half-pay as soon as they arrive.
Bump their kites on the wall!
And that is final!

Run! Run!
Then we saw him pick up
What a shame!
Okay, now! Pull his breath mask off.
Last time we didn't even stop timing until its lungs burst.
That's the wager.
No way this man-animal lasts more than four minutes.
Help me!
I need your air!

The wager's off. The damn thing cheated.
The Planetship is hiding something.
All we have to do is find out what it is...
then we'll have leverage.
And then we can get the gold.
What do you mean, we? It's my plan.
I'm sending the gold to Psychlo, then I'm getting off this stinking planet.
Come on, sir.
You do NOT want to play.
You gotta let me in on it.
I barely make any lousy credits in this job.
And I've got five wives to support, sir.
with a game that I call
I don't know if I want to partner up with an idiot.
How do I even know you understand the plan?
We train man-animals who don't need breath gas...
to mine the gold for us.
But Home Planet owns this planet. The gold belongs to them.
That's the beauty of it.
Home Planet doesn't know the gold exists.
Those corporate crapheads won't know we stole it.
It's the perfect crime, sir.
Putting aside the serious violations of teaching mining to inferiors...
And you take them away!
And then
and insulting corporate superiors, each one punishable by death.
So it is my duty to report you...
though you'll be vaporized, and I'll have to train a new assistant.
But it's your stinking plan, sir.
So I'm glad I have a recording of you...
Iaying out the plan and my reprimanding you.
I went after my net.
Think of it as part of your education.
Education, huh?
Never engage in a criminal activity unless you have a patsy to pin it on...
in case you ever get found out.
Then our fish said, Look! Look!
Thank you. That's great.
But why do I have to be the patsy?
So you don't get any bright ideas to get rid of Terl...
Oh, I like it a lot!
Have no fear! said the cat.
and keep the gold for yourself.
But I'd never double-cross you.
I've arranged that if any unfortunate accident were to befall me...
this would go straight to the Home Office.
Double or nothing I can blow off one of its limbs.
That one does seem to be unusually intelligent and resourceful.
But it's also defiant.
We'll need leverage over it.
I saw her. Your mother!
I sat there with Sally.
Leverage? Over a man-animal?
Man is a primitive species...
so we'll need something primitive for leverage. Like food.
And look!
What do you think a man-animal would like to eat?
What would he consider a treat?
How the crap should I know?
There's no way of knowing that.
But before we educate it on the machine...
we'll take it to the mountains with a couple of the others.
Let them think they've escaped...
and then we'll sit back and watch it choose its favorite food.
Yes.
Oh, the things they will hit!
He came down with a bump
Look!
Then, out of the box
Three days, and they still haven't eaten anything yet.
Precisely. Now that the man-animals feel...
that they have enough distance from us...
soon they'll find their favorite food and celebrate.
What is it?
The sun did not shine.
Food. Food!

No spark, no flints, nothing. You, Floyd?
They ran up! They ran down!
Plenty to burn. Nothing to start a fire with.
That's their favorite. -Of course it is.
With a sad kind of look.
They could've selected anything. -It's not cooked.
If man-animal prefers rat uncooked, then our job is that much easier.
If they like their rat so much, how come those two aren't eating?
Don't you know anything? The leader of the pack always eats first. See?
And Sally and I
We're really going to have leverage over them now.
What are you doing?

And so, said the ,
Oh, she will not like it
They know about the camera.
Don't be a knot-head. It's a man-animal.
It couldn't possibly know about it.
And a litte toy ship!
I can hold up the cup
You sure called that one, sir.
No way they know about the cameras.
Move your fat ass and let's go round them up!
Crap, lousy ceiling!
Great. This is great.
What do we do now?
What are you thinking, Jonnie? Don't even think about it.
As I hop on the ball!
They should not fly kites
You wouldn't live the jump, Jonnie. You wouldn't live the jump!
You can surrender and rot in those cages.
That's your choice. I'm not going back!
The
The monsters catch us, they'll take us to the mines.

Run!
How do we know what he wants?
They made me do this before. Follow me and you'll be fine.
Don't touch anything.
Get them mad, think what they'll do to us.
Excuse me, but I am your instructor...
if you'll forgive such arrogance...
for I do not have the honor to be a Psychlo.
But I like to be here.
I'm a lowly Clinko language slave.
As you are listening to me, I most likely do not exist...
as we may have been exterminated like many other races...
by the gas drones of our conquerors.
Please forgive my pretension...
You shook up our house
as I try to educate you in Psychlo...
the noble language of our superiors.
Said the fish in the pot.
Now look at this house!
You understand?
You understand me?
Are you hungry, little fella? Yes?
Put me down! said the fish.
Obviously, this is going to take a while.
Jonnie! Jonnie!
Carlo! Carlo!
I know who they are and where they're from. I can speak their language.
Then we saw one kite bump
Oh, what will she do to us?
so
Monsters? -They're called Psychlos.
What did they do to him?
They made him look into a light, a god machine.
It teaches. It's a knowledge machine.
It sends pictures through your head so fast, it's spinning.
Let's go, Jonnie. Come on.
No, I can't. I have to stay. I have to learn more about them.
He said, Do I like this?
This may be our only way out of here.
So this is the monster's language?
No, no. This is mathematics.
This is the unifying language of the entire universe.
Look.
And the sun is not sunny.
This symbol is called a triangle.
Did not know what to do.
If all these sides are equal...
then these three angles must also be equal.
When our mother is not.
With a tip of his hat.
We saw Mother's new gown!
Good trick that I know!
Equal to what?
To each other.
And this mess is so big
It's the basic foundation of Euclidean geometry.
What would YOU do
Seems pretty hard to understand.
No, only at first. And then it becomes clear in your mind.
And I said, How I wish
I learned molecular biology.
I will show you another
This is the symbol for water and engineering.
Look at me NOW!
See, a wing, see? And line and form and artistic composition.

You see, this is a square, like a cage.
Tell me. What did you do?
I thought we were supposed to be working on stuff to help us escape.
But you have to know how.
This will.
All this will.
Jonnie. Jonnie. Human.
The security chief should secure the field vault...
with an eight-digit combination code...
and do not use a personal or employee...
So, as fast as I could,
identification number. 
What's an identification number?
There.
Oh, no! I do not.
How many numbers is that? -Eight.
Eight?
Eight.
He picked up the cake,
It's more clever than that.
Said the cat.
The question is, how clever?
Tell that
Try the numbers backwards.
Bump! Thump! Thump! Bump!
Look at this.
BUMP!
It's a recording machine.
This is how he watches us.
Stop! Chrissy, stop!
Said the fish in the pot.
What if he's not dead?

I bet, with my net,
Hope is an admirable quality, but foolish isn't.
I can't give you permission to go and get killed.

I don't need your permission.
I'm no longer a child.
Do you want lunch?
It's obviously too much to ask a man-animal...
He should not be about.
to learn a language as sophisticated as Psychlo.
What if it can understand and it's pretending it can't?
What the hell for? -I don't know.
Maybe it's secretly listening, trying to get leverage over on us.
Man-animal getting leverage over a Psychlo. That'll be the day.
What if this one is particularly stupid?
Maybe we should train another one.
No time. When they detect the gold...
Take a look!
Thing One and Thing Two.
the Planetship will know what we're doing.
We'll have to terminate the operation and cover our tracks.
It speaks Psychlo.
Go on, say something else.
You'll stay here as my prisoner...
while you, you go and get a transporter.
Because you've learned Psychlo doesn't mean you are one.
Follow my orders or I'll have you killed.
How exactly do you plan to do that?
Mickey, no! -Mickey, no!
What to say.
And Sally and I,
We looked!
If any of you rat-brains knew anything about firearms...
Oh, no.
All the things that were down.
you would know that you never store loaded weapons.
You drop him now!
Drop him or I won't mine an ounce of your gold.
I'll have you vaporized and find someone else to mine it.
You don't have time.
You can't hide this from Home Office forever.
A man getting leverage over a Psychlo. That'll be the day.
I think it's time that we show our little friend a thing or two.
As long as you cling to the feeble hope...

that you'll ever get the better of me...
you'll be distracted from more important things.
Which is exactly why...
I share the following with you:
When we attacked your planet...
all your soldiers and all their advanced technology...
could only put up a nine-minute fight...

Look at me!
before they were exterminated.
I do NOT like the way that they play
Which is why man is an endangered species.
Everything you humans knew is here.
You can look at anything you want...

because there is nothing that will help you.
Satisfied?
Yes.
I have one more demonstration for you and your friends.
You will be relocated to a new mining site.
If any of you get any bright ideas about escaping...
keep in mind that although you know nothing about firearms, I do.
I graduated top marksman in my class. I can kill any of you at 1 000 paces.
Tell them what I said.
We try to run, he'll kill us.
That's it? -Yes.
Allow me to demonstrate.
No! Wait!
Let's give this demon what it deserves.
Kill it, I say! Destroy it!

And the milk and the cake!
Shoot! Shoot!
Why wait? Kill it!
Kill it. Then we'll run.
Then what?
What kind of life is it to run? Living in fear of being hunted?
From up there on the ball.
What about those we're leaving behind?
Have no fear! said the cat.
There's nothing we can do.
And with hops and big thumps
Only the gods can free them.
You think the lights in the sky are gods waiting to save us?
Do you? Those are planets, planets like this one.
The great villages were built by us.
By men and women just like us.
He should not be here.
Willing to fight to the death for one thing:
Their freedom!

On the top of my hat!
Do you think no one has tried?
You can't defeat them.
That is our fate.
When your mother is not!
Yes, we can. Yes, we can!
But we have to go back.
And Sally and I did not know

We go back and learn about their weapons.
Our race is slowly dying and will be gone forever.
Let it be said that we took this one chance and fought!
Are you with me? Are you with me?!
We fight!
If you're fighting the beast, me and my men are with you.
Thank you. It's good to have friends out here.
May the gods be with you.
With Thing One and Thing Two?
One as wise as you has ways to stop me from shooting.
I know if I'd tried, you would've killed me first.
Damn right, rat-brain! That's the first intelligent thing you've said.
Rest break is over.
There's something I need you to see so you're properly motivated.
You don't know her?
No, I don't know her.
She's one of the foulest looking females I've ever seen.
We shook their two hands.
While I tend to agree...
it's obvious that you show a lack of aptitude for strategic deception.
On the other hand, what you show marginal proficiency at is...

drawing.
This was found when she was collected.
Think of something to do!
The collar has enough explosives to remove her head from her body.
Sit!
And this remote...
will activate it from anywhere on the planet.
So if you disobey me, let me show you what will happen.
Please don't harm her.
I believe you.
Don't worry, rat-brain.
Every collar has its own frequency.
Not one little bit!
I'm not going to blow up your little female friend.
Said the cat with a bow.
Just...
this one.
You made your point.
I said I would mine your gold.
Please don't kill him. Please.
Then I said to the cat,
Fine.
Due to our new working relationship, I will grant you this one request.
I won't kill him.
Should we tell her about it?
But you may never ask of me anything again.
I promise.

As I've said, I won't kill him.
Yes, sir.
Stupid humans.
Said the cat.
No, no, no.
What you did was right.
It was right for all of us.
They should not be here
Greener, you're a thinker...
and the gods respect thinkers.
You didn't kill Sammy.
Jonnie, this is not living.
This is...
cages!
I will hold you up high
Cages!
Even if we escaped and went back to where we all came from...
it'd be like you said.
We'd be waiting for the Psychlos to hunt us down.
Look at this! Look at that!
But that is not all!
And a little toy man!
I think that is not living either.

With a tip of his hat.
We all chose to fight.
So, as fast as you can,
Count us in too! -What's going on?
Someone knows how to speak the Psychlo's language.
He's gonna help us fight.
Yes.
Ker, I'd like you to meet Chirk.
She's... .
His soon-to-be newly acquired secretary.
And I had them! At last!
Yes. -Really?
In this box are two things
She's stupid enough not to be a menace, pretty enough to be decorative.
She gets drunk with economical speed and has other advantages.
That is not all...
And THEN!
I can see that.
Don't you have some work to do? -No.
Ker?
All right, sir.
Now, listen, missy...
I can hold up the fish!
I'm still waiting for the Planetship's accounts.
I had to go way beyond the call of duty to get these.
And then he was gone
I will not let you fall.
I see. Well, that's why I especially chose you.
So you'll keep your side of the bargain?
Which was?
You said we'd have a huge house when we go back to Psychlo next year.
We had something to do!

To find us this way!
We're going to be rich, right? -Right.
I am going to make you as happy as a baby Psychlo...
on a straight diet of Kerbango.
Well, isn't it interesting...

that you have been keeping two sets of books...
and telling all the workers...
that the planet has been operating at a loss?
It is fun to have fun
They like to fly kites,
I only claimed that it was running at a loss...
Make that cat go away!
to try and motivate them all to work harder.
Oh, yes, of course.
And it had nothing to do with the fact...

A lot of good tricks.
that it allowed you to cut the workers' pay...
Put me down! said the fish.
Oh dear! said the cat,
and keep all the extra credit for yourself. Did it?
That. Well, I can explain that.
Well, unfortunately, the company requires me to vaporize you.
On the other hand...
I could understand someone in your situation...
being old and having no future...
And you bent our new rake.
But your mother will come.
coming up with ways to solve your financial problems.

You can? -Oh, yes.
Well...
There is no way at all!
It's really of no interest to anybody...
to have you not be Planetship.
But it would be prudent of you to start to share your authority.
And the fan, and the cup,
But these forms are all blank, undated.
You could put anything you wanted on them.
You would run the entire planet!
I would be nothing but a puppet.
Well, if you don't want to do it that way...
we could always do it by...
the book.
And I said, With my net
What the hell does the Planetship need with all this mining equipment?
That's not even the crazy part.
He's ordered me to take a group of man-animals to a remote area...
with the equipment to see if they can be trained to mine.
Man-animals being able to mine?
Yes.
Old Psychlo's gone completely insane.
Indeed.
But what can I do?
An order is an order.
You have a busy day, rat-brain.
Put them out! Put them out!
First, learning how to fly...
We sat there, we two.
then on to the learning machine for mining techniques.
Crash one more time...
Now, what SHOULD we do?
and your little friend will no longer be among the living.
Again.
Again!
Never underestimate what a little leverage can do, rat-brain.
That's good, man-animal.
This is the lever where we mine the gold!
Those Things should not be
Look at me now! said the cat.
Lever! Up, down!
Warning: External sensors indicate dangerous radiation levels ahead.
This is as far as I can go!
These Things are good Things.
Land it!
Meet me back here in 1 4 days.
I want the ship's cage half-filled with gold.
And even though I won't be at the mining site...
I'll be watching you.
How's your side? -It's good. Good.
Next time, you fly.
No, no, no. Even if we do mine enough gold...
we'll be lucky to fill half of that cage in time.
That's why we're not mining.
What about the big uglies watching us with that eye in the sky?
They said, How do you do?
Carlo, look. Here's the men, right?
We split them in half. One group goes...
and one group stays...
and it looks as if we're still working.
But if we don't deliver it in 1 4 days to Terl, he's just gonna kill us.
There's a place called Fort Knox where the gold's already been mined.
Listen, there will be no mining, but we'll deliver it.
Okay, so we have to pretend that we're mining the gold.
We have to figure out where we're gonna get the gold...
then we have to get the supplies to help our revolt.
Yeah.
Why, the cat!
But that is not all.
We barely have men to do one of those things...
So we had to shake hands
Iet alone all three.
For the day.
It's good to have friends on the outside!
Come on!
Then those Things ran about
If you two kept your eyes open, that'd be a great help.
Look for an ocean. If you see any, we've gone too far.
I think this is it.
I think we're in Washington.
We're still in Colorado. -That's impossible.
I've been watching, we haven't crossed this line.
You're not paying attention.
Let him navigate and watch me. You're gonna fly on the way back.
We couldn't have crossed all these lines.
Well, we did. The lines must have faded over time.
This great village was the capital for all our tribes.
This is where our people's history was buried.
Here. When the Psychlos attacked Earth...
they sent out flying gas drones.
Our ancestors must've made it out into these remote radiated areas...
and the only reason they survived was because radiation is...
Iethal to the Psychlos.
And that was not good for them. -That's good for us.
Even if we fail, the people will be safe if they stay--
Safe from being hunted...
but radiation is also poisonous for humans.
So, you see, either way...
if we don't take back our planet...
Then he shut up the Things
the last of humanity becomes extinct.
Based on what I've read about Psychlo security...
Sit!
And the rake, and the gown,
if we revolted...
only using weapons they don't perceive as any real threat...
if we just use rocks and sticks...
they'll just throw us back in the cages.
But...
we're gonna stage this revolt inside the dome.
And the books, and the dish,
So the Psychlos are gonna have to come inside the city to round us up.
How that bump made us jump!
And that is when we blow the dome.
Oh, no.
A big red wood box.
It was too wet to play.

Carlo's gonna blow the dome.
No, I do not like it,
They won't have masks. -They can't breathe.
They die. -Carlo?
I'm gonna blow the dome? -You're gonna blow the dome.
Piece of cake. Piece of cake, piece of cake.
Sank it deep in the cake.
But remember, as soon as we blow the dome...
boom, stage 2 alarm.

What is that?
Thousands of gas drones and troops will be teleported here.
We can't fight against that. -Then what's the point?
Two things. And I call them
If they send more monsters to Earth, we get wiped out.
Well, the point is, we don't let it get to stage 2.
We'll destroy their Home Planet before it happens.
Their Home Planet? -Their Home Planet.

We need some extra supplies before we can do that.
I can get them I bet.
Our first stop is a radiation bomb storage bunker.
Is everyone clear?
Count us in.
Look. -Flying machines.
These are flying machines. They're weapons of some kind.
Then we saw him step in on the mat!
That is what the cat said...
And he said to us,
Flying spears.
I think there's a little more to it than that.
It's a learning machine.
Teach us to fly.
You're right.
It's like breaking a horse.
No! Not in the house!
Can you teach your men to fly this?
Piece of cake, piece of cake. -Piece of cake.
Try and keep it level. -Jonnie!
What is it? -I think I found one.
Come on! Nuclear firebomb!
Do you hear!
On the string of one kite
Will not mind at all if I do.
Piece of cake.
According to the book, there's a firing mechanism...
When your mother is out!

that has to be in place before it's operational.
Don't touch the auto-sensor.
Who was back in the house?
What happens if we do?
The bomb will explode. Big fire.
Look. Greeners from this cave.
I know some new tricks,
Said the cat...
Off. Off.
War--
ning.
Warning. Warning.
Warning.
Warning.
Get it?
Sit!
What does the auto-sensor look like?
There's an illustration in Appendix A.
What? What?
I will show them to you.
We don't have Appendix A.
More books, Jonnie.
It's okay.
I thought you said nuclear fires were powerful?
It's not nuclear. Mickey!
Sorry.
You're sorry. Mickey!
But we can have
They have come here to play.
Now look what you did!
She will find this big mess!
Stop touching things and turn off the damn light.
Leave it on.
Look.
Good work, Mickey.
Your mother is near!
You just found Appendix A.
Will this be enough to blow up their whole planet?
Radiation reacts with their planet's atmosphere.
There's enough to destroy it forever. -Let me do it.
Let me go there and detonate the weapon.
It's brave of you, Mickey, but it's my plan, so I go.
You're the only one who speaks the monsters' language.
You know things about them!
So all we could do was to
Listen...
You will see something new.
without you leading this revolt...

something went BUMP!
we might not succeed.
I hope their eye in the sky didn't see the gold through the lead walls.
Start filling the cage.
We'll hide half and deliver the other half to Terl tonight.
Why is it in bars?
And we saw him!
I assumed, sir...
that a Psychlo of your refinement wouldn't want raw ore.
Really?
Since you have had extra time...
On the head of her bed!
I can get those Things yet!
to smelt it into bricks...
I'll expect the rest of the gold in seven days.
He has no intention of sharing that gold with you.
And then he ran out.
What the hell are you talking about?
And the milk, and the strings,
Should we tell her
Why are you here? You should be mining the gold!
Do you hear?
You really think the only reason he made that recording...
was to have you as his patsy? Do you, Ker?
What a shame!
No. He has leverage over you...
and it'll guarantee you never see an ounce.
How do you know about those recordings?
It really is amazing...
the collection of discs you find in Terl's personal vault.
First, we trade.
The disc-- -I don't think so!

Because if you don't give me the disc now...
I will blow your head off.
You want to trade?
Let's trade.
Hooray!
I can hold a red fan!
Won't the Psychlo see I'm not wearing the collar?
After tonight, won't matter much either way.
Jonnie, I know you don't believe in fate...
I always pick up all my playthings
but I've always known this was your destiny.
This is our destiny. It's freedom for all of us.
I do NOT wish to fall!
For our children.
It was shut with a hook.
Children?
They will give you some fun
Beautiful.
Quickly!
So
And so deep and so tall,
What if this one is particularly stupid?
There's no time. When they detect the gold...
 the Planetship will know what we're doing.
They are tame. Oh, so tame!
Did not know what to say.
We'll have to terminate the operation and cover our tracks.
When they detect the gold, the Planetship will know what we're doing.
so...
We'll have to terminate the operation and cover our tracks.
I've been thinking.
As I stand on a ball.
You will have to get rid of
80/20 is a pretty fair distribution of the gold.
We did nothing at all.
Then our mother came in
But I should get the 80% .
And with my share, I'm gonna fire all my wives...
and buy new ones.
Said the cat.
Maybe pretty ones this time.
Ker-bango!
Congratulations.
You've learned how to get leverage over someone, haven't you?
Which means I haven't wasted my time training you, have l?
Came back in with a box.
You're not upset? -Don't be crazy.

He fell into a pot!
You know how long I've waited for this day?
I know the perfect way to celebrate.
What are you doing?
You can't shoot me.

I made a copy and gave it to someone for safekeeping.
You are just too good of a teacher.
This is not a good game,
How about giving your old teacher a clue as to who this might be?
You insult yourself, sir.
You taught me better.
How am I supposed to know who it is?
I don't know.
It could be anybody on this damn planet.
It could be a mechanic. -No.
It could be a concubine. -No, no.
It could be anybody in communications.
We ca not pick it up.
Oh, the things they will bump!

Wrong!
I hate these things. It's like it's a test I'm not prepared for.
My tricks are not bad,
Well, hell, it could even be our friendly bartender!
Please. I made a mistake.
Said the cat.
Now, give me the original disc...
then meet me at the teleportation platform in two hours.
Sir.
And he put them away.
The control bunker's to the right.

Three guards left.
Two from the guardhouse, one coming from the north.
I'll take the guardhouse.
Jonnie, the shooting's triggered the alarm.
Five guards from the south, heavily armed and moving fast.
Between you and the bunker.
But our fish said, No! No!
Jonnie!
I know it is wet
The man-animals have escaped. They're running into the city.
And our fish came down, too.
Send some guards out and round them up. I'm busy.
Don't bother me with every little detail.
Gotta round them up.
Psychlos!
And, then, fast as a fox,
Psychlos!
7-7-3.
Greener? Carlo. Explosives are set. Can I blow the dome?
Greener?
So we sat in the house.
Why do you sit there like that?
What's going on? Talk to me!
It's Carlo. What's going on? Talk to me.
Another good game that I know!
Hold on!
If I don't get Mickey to Psychlo, they'll send drones.
Well, hurry up. Just hurry up, because I've got company.
Here they are.
Panther!
Hang on. I'm right on his tail.
You know what you gotta do.
With a cup and a cake
I can hold up TWO books!
Have no fear, little fish,
Said the fish to the cat.
Greener, come on.
I've gotta blow this dome now!
I will show to you now.
I'm teleporting Mickey and the bomb. Hang on.
We saw those two Things
In a house! They should not.
I'm seconds away.
Now look at this trick,
Jonnie, come on.
Said our fish as he lit.
They're destroying the bombs.
It's now or never. -Now!
Now, go ahead! Blow the dome! Go! Go! Go!
Teleportation sequence terminated.
Interrupting something?
Jonnie? Jonnie?
And he gave them a pat.

Why isn't it coming down?

The dome is holding!
It's not working. -It's only cracked!
Oh, I do not like it!
And the ship, and the fish.
The dome isn 't broken. We can 't hold out long.
Attention! This is Terl, your chief of security.

Our mother was out of the house
Exterminate all man-animals at will.
And happy hunting!
Run! Run!
What's with the dome?
I can fan with the fan
Hold on, I'm taking it out now.
Help us!
You sank our toy ship,
They're killing us!
We're not gonna make it! I think we should pull out!
I'm blowing the dome. In five.
With Thing One and Thing Two.
Four.

Too wet to go out
Three.
Two.
One.
Piece of cake.
Everyone on the ground now! Go!

What will she say?
Teleportation sequence activated.
Teleportation sequence activated.

Psychlo War Center, this is a stage 3 alert!
I repeat, a stage 3 alert.
Initiate the gas drone extermination sequence.
You have been quite a challenge, rat-brain.
You'll make a hell of a conversation piece...
when you're stuffed and hanging on the academy wall.
Where's the rest of my gold?
I'll exchange it for my woman's life.
My life is over, but hers is of no consequence to you.
Thanks for reminding me, rat-brain. Now, where is it?
Trust me, you don't want to do that.
Trust me, there's nothing I want more.
Carlo came through.
He has gone away. Yes.
Why don't you vaporize me?
Then Sally and I
Leverage.
If there are other Psychlo colonies out there...
they'll send out gas drones and exterminate us.
But if they learn that it was your greed...
And our fish shook with fear.
that destroyed their Home Planet...
then all the credits in the universe...
won't equal the bounty on your head.
But there is one thing you rat-brains weren't smart enough to realize.
Kill them.
And too cold to play ball.
I fixed the problem with it.
It works now. -You imbecile!
What kind of game are you playing?
Since I'm teaching them our technology, they made me the head Psychlo.
Thing Two and Thing One!
Look at the bright side.
You may not be wallowing in luxury on Psychlo...
but at least you finally got your gold.
